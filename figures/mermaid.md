# BEAT Heartbeat (Conceptual)

The diagram below provides a **conceptual visualization** of the BEAT
(Behavioral–External Alignment Theory) heartbeat.

It illustrates how **internal strain** and **external capacity** evolve over
time and how their divergence corresponds to BEAT stability phases.

This figure is illustrative and non-empirical.
