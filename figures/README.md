# Figures and Visualizations

This directory contains conceptual and empirical visualizations for the  
**BEAT (Behavioral–External Alignment Theory)** framework.

Figures are intended to communicate BEAT’s core logic visually rather than to
optimize statistical presentation.

## The BEAT “Heartbeat”

The central visualization of BEAT is the **heartbeat diagram**.

It represents the dynamic relationship between:
- **Internal strain** (domestic stress, unrest, institutional pressure), and
- **External capacity** (authority, coherence, ability to project control).

The heartbeat metaphor emphasizes that:
- Stability is dynamic, not static
- Divergence can persist before collapse
- Breakdown is a process, not an event

## Conceptual Heartbeat Diagram

A typical heartbeat visualization shows:

- **X-axis:** Time  
- **Y-axis:** System stress / alignment (abstracted)

Two signals are represented:
1. Internal strain signal (rising volatility, amplitude)
2. External capacity signal (flattening, delayed response)

Phase transitions occur when the signals diverge or converge in characteristic ways.

## Phase Signatures (Visual Intuition)

- **Phase 2 (Aligned Stability):**  
  Low amplitude, synchronized signals

- **Phase 3 (Divergence):**  
  Rising internal amplitude while external signal remains stable

- **Phase 4 (Sustained Instability):**  
  Persistent high internal amplitude; external signal degrades

- **Phase 5 (Coherence Loss):**  
  Signal desynchronization and collapse of structure

These signatures are diagnostic patterns, not precise measurements.

## Empirical Figures

Empirical figures may include:
- Country-level heartbeat traces
- Phase timelines
- Comparative phase distributions
- Case-study overlays (e.g. USSR, Yugoslavia)

Empirical plots are illustrative and should be interpreted alongside
the documented scope and limitations of BEAT.

---

## Design Principles

Figures should:
- Favor interpretability over precision
- Avoid false visual certainty
- Reflect phase logic rather than point prediction

Figures should not:
- Imply probabilistic forecasts
- Suggest deterministic collapse paths
- Be used outside documented scope

---

## Status

This directory will be populated iteratively.
Conceptual figures take priority over stylistic polish.

---

## Versioning

Figures correspond to **BEAT v1.0** unless otherwise noted.
