# BEAT Roadmap

This roadmap outlines potential future directions for the **BEAT (Behavioral–External Alignment Theory)** framework.

BEAT v1.0 is framework-complete.  
Items listed here are optional extensions, not required components.

---

## Current Status

**BEAT v1.0**
- Core phase logic finalized
- Scope and boundaries explicitly defined
- Empirically stress-tested
- Publicly released and versioned

No breaking changes are planned.

---

## Near-Term (Documentation & Clarity)

These items improve usability without altering theory:

- Add conceptual heartbeat figures
- Add illustrative case-study examples (non-predictive)
- Improve README cross-linking
- Add short glossary of terms

---

## Medium-Term (Optional Extensions)

These items extend BEAT while preserving core logic:

- Additional internal strain indicators (economic, demographic)
- Alternative authority measures (non-Polity sources)
- Modular extensions for specific domains (e.g. empires, federations)
- Improved visualization templates

All extensions should preserve:
- conservative Phase 5 assignment
- explicit scope boundaries
- diagnostic (not predictive) intent

---

## Long-Term (Research Directions)

These items represent exploratory directions only:

- Comparative evaluation against existing stability indices
- Formal theoretical paper or white paper
- Historical synthesis using BEAT across eras
- Integration with qualitative case-study workflows

Inclusion here does not imply commitment or prioritization.

---

## Governance Principles

- Core phase logic should not change without a major version increment
- Scope expansion must be explicit and documented
- Predictive use cases are out of scope
- Transparency and restraint are preferred over feature growth

---

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome if they:
- Respect BEAT’s diagnostic intent
- Preserve scope boundaries
- Improve clarity, replication, or documentation

Proposed changes to core logic should be discussed openly before implementation.

---

## Versioning

This roadmap corresponds to **BEAT v1.0**.
