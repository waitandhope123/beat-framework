# Roles and Contributions

This document clarifies the roles and contributions involved in the development
of the **BEAT (Behavioral–External Alignment Theory)** framework.

The purpose is transparency, not attribution inflation.

---

## Framework Originator and Lead Author

**Role:** Human author and framework originator

Responsibilities include:
- Formulating the core theoretical concept (internal–external divergence)
- Defining the heartbeat metaphor and phase logic
- Determining scope, boundaries, and intended use
- Making final methodological and design decisions
- Directing empirical testing, recalibration, and validation strategy
- Approving all public-facing documentation and releases

All intellectual responsibility for BEAT rests with the human author.

## AI-Assisted Contributor (Chat-Based)

**Role:** Analytical and drafting assistant

Contributions include:
- Assisting with structured reasoning and iteration
- Helping formalize concepts into written documentation
- Supporting empirical diagnostics and recalibration logic
- Drafting explanatory text, templates, and examples
- Helping identify failure modes, boundary conditions, and risks
- Supporting repository organization and documentation clarity

The AI assistant does not originate theoretical claims independently and does
not make final decisions.

---

## Decision Authority

- All conceptual, methodological, and release decisions are made by the
  human author.
- AI assistance is advisory and instrumental only.
- The human author retains full responsibility for interpretation, use,
  and dissemination of the framework.

## Attribution Guidance

When referencing BEAT:
- Attribute authorship to the human author
- Do not list the AI assistant as an author
- AI assistance may be acknowledged, if desired, as a tool used in development

Example acknowledgment (optional):

> “This work was developed with the assistance of AI-based analytical tools.”

## Rationale

This clarification exists to:
- Avoid ambiguity about authorship and responsibility
- Prevent misinterpretation of AI involvement
- Support academic, analytical, and professional use
- Preserve accountability and intellectual ownership
