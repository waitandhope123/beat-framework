# BEAT Context Seed

This file preserves the full conceptual, empirical, and design context of the
BEAT (Behavioral–External Alignment Theory) framework so that development,
discussion, or analysis can be resumed in a new environment or conversation
without loss of intent.

This is a continuity artifact, not a formal specification.

---

## What BEAT Is

BEAT is a **phase-based diagnostic framework** for state stability across history.

It models how **internal strain** and **external capacity** diverge and converge
over time, classifying states into **stability phases** rather than producing
single scores or point predictions.

BEAT is explicitly:
- diagnostic, not predictive
- phase-based, not index-based
- historically general, not era-specific
- conservative about collapse claims

---

## Core Insight

States do not usually fail because they are weak everywhere at once.

They fail when:
- internal strain rises and persists, while
- external capacity appears intact or lags, until
- coherence between authority, territory, and force is lost.

This divergence–convergence dynamic is the core of BEAT.

---

## Stability Phases (v1.0)

- **Phase 2 — Aligned Stability**  
  Internal and external systems are mutually reinforcing.

- **Phase 3 — Divergence (Strain Phase)**  
  Internal strain rises while external capacity remains superficially strong.
  This is the primary early-warning phase.

- **Phase 4 — Sustained Instability (Warning Phase)**  
  Persistent internal stress erodes regime authority.
  Reversal is possible but uncommon.

- **Phase 5 — Coherence Loss (Breakdown Confirmation)**  
  The state loses coherence over authority, territory, or monopoly of force.
  Phase 5 is confirmatory, not predictive, and intentionally rare.

---

## Operational Dimensions

BEAT evaluates three interacting dimensions:

1. **Internal Strain**  
   Domestic unrest, institutional stress, persistent volatility.

2. **Regime / Authority Stress**  
   Loss of legitimacy, sharp regime deterioration, institutional ambiguity.

3. **State Coherence**  
   Ability to maintain monopoly of authority and violence.

Phase 5 requires evidence of **coherence loss**.

## Data Foundations (Used in Development)

Minimal modern implementation:
- CNTS (internal strain)
- Polity / Polity5 (regime authority)
- Correlates of War (state coherence, dissolution, intra-state conflict)

Supplementary and contextual:
- QoG (institutional context)
- NMC (capacity context)
- Maddison Project, population history (deep-time background)
- Climate proxies (ancient/pre-modern context only)

Licensed datasets are not redistributed.

---

## Calibration Philosophy

- Prefer **interpretability over fit**
- Favor **low false positives** over aggressive prediction
- Treat Phase 5 as confirmation, not warning
- Concentrate early warning in Phases 3 and 4
- Explicitly classify failure modes rather than hide them

---

## Empirical Status (v1.0)

- Phase 5: high precision, low frequency (confirmatory)
- Phase 4: tuned for warning recall (~45% within 3 years)
- Phase ≥3: broader early warning (~50%+ within 3 years)
- Overall diagnostic accuracy: ~70–75% within intended scope

---

## Known Failure Modes (Explicit)

- EO — External Override (invasion)
- DS — Dependent / colonial states
- RC — Rapid collapse (no buildup)
- MN — Microstate noise
- CF — Chronic fragility without breakdown
- DA — Data availability / alignment limits

These define BEAT’s boundaries.

---

## What BEAT Is Not

- Not a collapse predictor
- Not a risk scoring system
- Not a probabilistic forecast
- Not suitable for tactical or short-term decision-making

---

## Design Intent

BEAT is meant to:
- survive falsification attempts
- remain usable across centuries
- resist overinterpretation
- make its own limits explicit

The framework prioritizes **epistemic discipline** over apparent accuracy.

---

## Current State

BEAT v1.0 is:
- framework-complete
- empirically stress-tested
- scoped and bounded
- publicly released

Future work may add:
- visualizations
- examples
- extensions

Core phase logic should not change without explicit versioning.

---

## Continuity Instruction

If BEAT is resumed in a new chat or environment:

- Treat this file as authoritative context
- Assume BEAT v1.0 definitions and scope
- Do not assume predictive intent
- Preserve conservative Phase 5 logic
- Preserve explicit boundary conditions

---

## Version

This context seed corresponds to **BEAT v1.0**.
