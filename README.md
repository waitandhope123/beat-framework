# BEAT Framework

**BEAT (Behavioral–External Alignment Theory)** is a phase-based framework for diagnosing state stability across history.

Rather than producing single risk scores or point predictions, BEAT classifies states into **stability phases** based on the alignment and divergence between:
- **Internal strain** (e.g. unrest, institutional stress), and
- **External capacity** (e.g. regime authority, state coherence).

The framework is designed to work across historical eras—from ancient empires to modern nation-states—and is explicitly bounded in scope. BEAT is a **diagnostic tool**, not a collapse predictor.

---

## What BEAT Does

- Classifies states into **stability phases** instead of ranks or scores  
- Distinguishes **early structural warning** from **confirmed breakdown**  
- Applies consistently across **long historical time horizons**  
- Makes failure modes explicit rather than hiding them  

BEAT is intended for historical analysis, comparative politics, and structured diagnostics—not for short-term forecasting.

## Core Concepts

### Stability Phases (simplified)
- **Phase 2** — Stable alignment  
- **Phase 3** — Internal strain and divergence  
- **Phase 4** — Sustained instability (warning phase)  
- **Phase 5** — Loss of state coherence (breakdown confirmation)

Phase definitions are formalized in `/docs`.

## Data Foundations

Empirical testing and calibration draw on established datasets, including:
- CNTS (internal unrest and conflict)
- Polity (regime authority and transitions)
- Correlates of War (state membership, intra-state conflict)
- Supplementary historical and climatic datasets

Raw licensed data are **not redistributed** here. This repository focuses on theory, methods, and reproducible workflows.

## Scope and Boundaries

BEAT performs best for:
- Sovereign states
- Endogenous or hybrid breakdown processes
- Gradual institutional decay

BEAT is **not designed** for:
- Pure external invasions
- Colonial or dependent states
- Instantaneous collapses
- Microstates with high data noise

These boundaries are documented and treated as features, not flaws.

## Repository Structure (initial)
/docs        → theory, phase definitions, scope /notebooks   → exploratory analyses and stress tests /scripts     → data processing and diagnostics /figures     → conceptual and empirical visuals

---

## Status

BEAT is framework-complete and empirically stress-tested.  
Ongoing work focuses on documentation, visualization, and application.
