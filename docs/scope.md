# Scope, Boundaries, and Failure Modes

This document defines the **intended scope**, **explicit boundaries**, and **known failure modes** of the BEAT framework.

BEAT is designed as a **diagnostic theory of endogenous state stability**.  
It does not attempt to explain or predict all forms of political change.

Explicit boundaries are a feature of the framework, not a limitation.

---

## Intended Scope

BEAT is designed to apply to:

- Sovereign states
- Polities with meaningful internal authority
- Systems where internal strain and external capacity interact over time
- Gradual or hybrid breakdown processes

Within this scope, BEAT performs best at:
- Identifying **structural divergence**
- Distinguishing **warning phases** from **confirmed breakdown**
- Enabling cross-historical comparison

---

## Out-of-Scope Cases

BEAT is **not designed** to model the following cases:

### 1. Pure External Invasion
Examples:
- Kuwait (1990)
- Panama (1989)

**Reason:**  
State failure is externally imposed rather than endogenously generated.

---

### 2. Colonial or Dependent States
Examples:
- Protectorates
- Client states with limited sovereignty

**Reason:**  
Internal strain does not translate into autonomous state decisions.

---

### 3. Instantaneous or Silent Collapse
Examples:
- Rapid regime implosions with no observable buildup

**Reason:**  
Phase-based diagnostics require observable temporal structure.

---

### 4. Microstates
Examples:
- Very small populations or city-states

**Reason:**  
Event-count data exhibit high noise relative to system size.

---

## Failure Taxonomy

Empirical stress testing identifies the following failure categories:

### EO — External Override
Collapse driven primarily by foreign intervention.

### DS — Dependent State
Breakdown driven by patron withdrawal or external authority.

### RC — Rapid Collapse
Institutional failure occurs faster than measurement windows.

### MN — Microstate Noise
Signal distortion due to small-N effects.

### CF — Chronic Fragility
Persistent instability without discrete breakdown.

### DA — Data Availability
Failure due to sparse or misaligned historical records.

---

## Interpretation Guidance

- Failure cases do **not** invalidate the framework.
- They define where BEAT’s assumptions do not hold.
- Boundary recognition is required for correct application.

Users are expected to:
- Identify scope compatibility before applying BEAT
- Avoid retrospective reinterpretation of out-of-scope cases

---

## What BEAT Is Not

BEAT is not:
- A collapse prediction engine
- A single-number risk index
- A short-term forecasting tool
- A replacement for contextual analysis

---

## Versioning

This scope definition corresponds to **BEAT v1.0**.
Changes to scope or boundaries will be versioned explicitly.
