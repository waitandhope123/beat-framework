# BEAT Stability Phases

This document defines the stability phases used in **BEAT (Behavioral–External Alignment Theory)**.

BEAT models state stability as a **phase process**, not a continuous score.  
Each phase represents a distinct structural condition in the relationship between **internal strain** and **external capacity**.

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Label | Description |
|-----|------|------------|
| P2 | Aligned Stability | Internal and external systems are broadly aligned |
| P3 | Divergence | Internal strain rising while external capacity remains intact |
| P4 | Sustained Instability | Persistent internal stress with weakening authority |
| P5 | Coherence Loss | Breakdown of state coherence and monopoly of authority |

BEAT does not assume phases are strictly linear or irreversible, but transitions are **path-dependent**.

## Phase 2 — Aligned Stability

**Definition:**  
Internal conditions and external capacity are mutually reinforcing.

**Characteristics:**
- Low or moderate internal unrest
- Institutions function as intended
- Regime authority is broadly accepted
- External performance reflects internal health

**Interpretation:**  
Phase 2 represents structural stability, not perfection.  
States can experience shocks without leaving Phase 2 if alignment holds.

---

## Phase 3 — Divergence (Strain Phase)

**Definition:**  
Internal strain begins to rise while external capacity still appears strong.

**Characteristics:**
- Increasing unrest, protests, or political stress
- Institutions remain formally intact
- External indicators (power, legitimacy) lag internal deterioration

**Interpretation:**  
Phase 3 is the **primary early warning phase** in BEAT.  
Most states experiencing serious future instability pass through Phase 3.

Phase 3 does **not** imply inevitable collapse.

---

## Phase 4 — Sustained Instability (Warning Phase)

**Definition:**  
Internal strain becomes persistent and begins to erode regime authority.

**Characteristics:**
- Sustained internal unrest across multiple years
- Declining institutional effectiveness
- Regime stress, sharp legitimacy loss, or rapid authority erosion
- Volatility replaces episodic disturbance

**Interpretation:**  
Phase 4 represents **structural danger**.  
Reversal is possible but increasingly costly and rare.

In empirical testing, Phase 4 provides the strongest balance between:
- early warning, and
- resistance to false alarms.

---

## Phase 5 — Coherence Loss (Breakdown Confirmation)

**Definition:**  
The state loses coherence over territory, authority, or monopoly of force.

**Characteristics:**
- Intra-state war participation
- Fragmentation of authority
- State dissolution or functional collapse
- External capacity no longer compensates for internal failure

**Interpretation:**  
Phase 5 is **confirmatory**, not predictive.  
It indicates that breakdown is underway or unavoidable under current conditions.

BEAT intentionally assigns Phase 5 conservatively.

---

## Phase Transitions

- Transitions are driven by **convergence or divergence** between internal strain and external capacity.
- Phase skipping is possible in cases of rapid collapse or external override.
- Reversal (e.g., Phase 4 → Phase 3) is possible but historically uncommon.

---

## Scope Notes

BEAT phases are not designed to classify:
- Pure external invasions
- Colonial or dependent polities
- Microstates with extreme data volatility
- Instantaneous collapses with no observable buildup

These cases are treated as **out-of-scope boundary conditions**.

---

## Usage Guidance

- Use **Phase 3–4** for diagnostic and comparative analysis
- Treat **Phase 5** as breakdown confirmation, not a forecast
- Avoid collapsing phases into a single numeric index
