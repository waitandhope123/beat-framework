# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ addresses common questions and potential misunderstandings about the **BEAT (Behavioral–External Alignment Theory)** framework.

---

## Is BEAT a prediction model?

No.

BEAT is a **diagnostic framework**, not a forecasting or prediction system.  
It classifies states into stability phases based on observed structural conditions.

BEAT does **not** produce:
- collapse dates
- probabilities
- point predictions

---

## Can BEAT predict state collapse?

No — and it is not intended to.

BEAT’s highest phase (Phase 5) is **confirmatory**, indicating loss of state coherence, not a forecast of future collapse.

Early warning functionality is concentrated in **Phases 3 and 4**, which signal structural risk rather than inevitability.

---

## How is BEAT different from risk indices or rankings?

Most indices:
- compress multiple dimensions into a single score
- obscure mechanisms
- encourage false precision

BEAT:
- uses **discrete phases**
- preserves causal structure
- separates warning from confirmation
- explicitly defines scope and failure modes

---

## Why not use a single numeric stability score?

Single scores:
- hide structural divergence
- conflate noise with trend
- encourage overinterpretation

BEAT phases are designed to be **interpretable states**, not points on a scale.

---

## Why is Phase 5 so rare?

Phase 5 requires:
- sustained internal strain,
- regime stress, and
- loss of state coherence.

This is intentional.

Overuse of “collapse” labels reduces analytical value and increases false positives.  
BEAT prefers conservative confirmation over frequent alarms.

---

## Can a state recover from Phase 4?

Yes, but historically this is uncommon.

Reversal from Phase 4 typically requires:
- major institutional reform,
- regime replacement, or
- external stabilization.

BEAT does not assume irreversibility, but it treats reversals as exceptional.

---

## Can a state skip phases?

Yes.

Phase skipping can occur in:
- rapid collapses,
- external invasions,
- cases of sudden authority withdrawal.

These cases are explicitly documented as boundary conditions.

---

## Does BEAT apply to empires and ancient states?

Yes.

BEAT is designed to be **historically general**, and its logic has been tested against ancient, medieval, and modern cases.

Operational indicators vary by era, but the phase logic remains consistent.

---

## Why doesn’t BEAT handle invasions well?

Because invasions are **exogenous shocks**.

BEAT models **endogenous stability**—how internal strain and authority interact over time.  
External override cases violate this assumption and are treated as out of scope.

---

## Why doesn’t BEAT always “catch” collapses in advance?

Some collapses:
- occur too rapidly,
- are externally imposed,
- or lack observable buildup.

BEAT is optimized for **structural decay**, not instantaneous failure.

---

## Is BEAT falsifiable?

Yes.

BEAT makes explicit claims about:
- when warnings should appear,
- when breakdown should be confirmed,
- and where the framework should not apply.

Failures are classified rather than ignored.

---

## Can BEAT be extended?

Yes.

BEAT is designed to be modular.  
Additional indicators (economic, demographic, environmental) can be layered on without changing the core phase logic.

---

## What is BEAT best used for?

BEAT is best used for:
- historical comparison
- structured diagnostics
- regime and state analysis
- avoiding overreaction to short-term noise

It is **not** a substitute for contextual expertise.

---

## Who is BEAT for?

BEAT is intended for:
- historians
- political scientists
- analysts
- researchers interested in state stability across time

It assumes careful, informed use.
